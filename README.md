# Online-Cab-Booking-Services--DAA-Project


In the world where everyone prefers affordable and fast means of transportation, online platforms which help in booking vehicles have gained momentum off late. Google maps, ola and uber cabs provide a lot of services today that help in comfortable commute. 
          Our project deals with the prototype of a cab booking service. Firstly, the user is prompted to enter the source and destination. Then, a list of all the vehicles available is displayed to the user. The user can choose the vehicle based on the drivers rating, comfort zone and cost. After the booking is confirmed, a message is displayed showing the OTP and the price of the fare. The time at which the cab will reach the userâ€™s current location will also be displayed. For this, we plan to use the shortest path algorithm.   A city is a road network. It is assumed that the city has certain landmarks. Each of these landmarks is considered to be a node. This becomes a graph framework. The path that connects two nodes is assigned a value based on the traffic of the city at that particular time. So, based on that the shortest path is chosen by the driver and the amount of time required by the driver to reach his customer is displayed. When the destination is reached, the payment is done and the service is completed.
          So, on the whole, we plan to use graphs that represent a road network, greedy approach to satisfy the user based on his needs, print the OTP and shortest path algorithm to display the time. Also, all pair shortest paths algorithm is used which is a part of dynamic programming.
